Maritim Hub is a comprehensive maritime information system developed for Indonesia's Ministry of Transportation (Kemenhub). The platform serves as a centralized hub for maritime data, policies, and digital services, ensuring accessibility for stakeholders in the maritime sector.

As a Frontend Engineer, I contributed to the development, optimization, and feature enhancements of the platform, focusing on improving user experience (UI/UX), performance, and accessibility across multiple devices.

#### Outcome & Impact
* Enhanced system usability, leading to improved adoption by stakeholders.
* Increased platform responsiveness & performance, ensuring a seamless user experience for maritime professionals.
* Strengthened security through access control measures, ensuring safe data management.
